Dating website for dogs, where dogs owners can meet and organize dates for their pets, to have amazing plays or unforgettable walks

#### GitHub Repositories

The repository for the FrontEnd part is available here :  [O'poils Front Github](https://github.com/Kathleen-Vierstraete/opoils-front "O'poils GitHub Front")

The repository for the BackEnd part is available here :  [O'poils Back Github](https://github.com/Kathleen-Vierstraete/opoils-back "O'poils GitHub Back")

#### Home Page

The website O'poils was developed via React-Redux for the FrontEnd part, combined with HTML/SCSS, and via Symphony for the BackEnd and the API routes. The application was build in a team, with 3 persons. One person was in charge of the FrontEnd part and the other 2 in charge of the BackEnd part, with a daily communication based on Agility. The project was fully remotely developed.

#### Navigation on the site 

Once logged in, the user can visit the dogs' profile pages :

![Opoils Dogs Page](../../../../public/assets/images/opoils/opoils-dogs-page.png 'Opoils Dogs Page')

but also visit one dog's profile page specifically :

![Opoils Dog Profile](../../../../public/assets/images/opoils/opoils-dog-profile.png 'Opoils Dog Profile')

The user can visit the members' profile pages :

![Opoils Members Page](../../../../public/assets/images/opoils/opoils-members-page.png 'Opoils Members Page')

but also visit one member's profile page specifically :

![Opoils Member Profile](../../../../public/assets/images/opoils/opoils-member-profile.png 'Opoils Member Profile')

The user can access his/her own account, to add or update a dog's profile for instance:

#### The backoffice, admin side

To be able to handle the dogs' and members' profiles, the site admins can access the backoffice. This part was developed via the Symfony framework and TWIG integrations.

The admin can see the profiles (dogs or members), create, update or delete them. (CRUD)
